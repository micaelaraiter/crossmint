# Task: Crossmint Assignment

## Map 1

For this challenge, what I needed to consider was a generic way to create the cross, and I didn't want to hardcode the positions. The first thing I could obtain was those locations that were on the margins since the matrix is square and was located in the center, so it was relatively easy to determine. After staring at the map for a while, I realized that I had to mark both the main matrix and its inverted counterpart.
