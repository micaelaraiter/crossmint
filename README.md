# Task: Crossmint Assignment

## Map 1

For this challenge, what I needed to consider was a generic way to create the cross, and I didn't want to hardcode the positions. The first thing I could obtain was those locations that were on the margins since the matrix is square and was located in the center, so it was relatively easy to determine. After staring at the map for a while, I realized that I had to mark both the main matrix and its inverted counterpart. I know I made it extra complicated, but I wanted to show you my creative side :D

## Map 2

In this exercise I took the more traditional way, use a json and based on the reading of the json go marking the different positions. I thought it was right to use the strategy design pattern so that the code would be neater.
